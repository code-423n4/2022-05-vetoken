Feel free to ask me any questions.  Looking forward to working with you guys.


[05/26/2022 20:54] bernd_42
Are all files within the `./contracts` folder in scope of this contest?


[05/26/2022 21:11] Jaqen#8180
The scope of the contest mentioned in the readme .  But in order to deploy and run it, you may need the all the contracts in order to work through the logics


[05/26/2022 21:13] bernd_42
I'm asking because in the readme it is not explicitly mentioned which contracts are _in_ scope or _out_ of scope. It only mentions "Contracts Of Interest"

{Reactions}
👍 

[05/26/2022 21:25] Jaqen#8180
Oh, got it. Good point.  I will update the readme to be more clear . 

But just for you know , : 

contracts of interest = scope of the contest

Hello Wardens ,
Hoping you are having good weekends .

To encourage the participation and appreciate you guys helping us to make the contracts more secure,  we decided to provide additional rewards as $VE3D ,  ($150K at $500m mkv ) for the auditors that would able to find critical issues including fund could be frozen in the pools or get stolen , drained. Etc. 

We are working with C4 team to figure out how to fairly distribute this to you.  But just would like to let you guys know now that there will be additional rewards coming .

veToken finance is well backed projects by curve , yearn , prep etc co founders and core members , we hope to build a generic tool for all projects that adopt ve model .

Looking forward to working with you all along this journey.

Thanks very much
Jaqen

[05/28/2022 16:10] illilli000
can you explain a little bit more about what "$150K at $500m mkv" means? Just trying to see if it's immediately redeemable for usd, or if there is some implied vesting/benchmarking


[05/28/2022 16:13] Jaqen#8180
it will be distributed by VE3D with vesting period (4-10weeks,  haven’t decided it ) after project launched.


[05/28/2022 16:15] Jaqen#8180
The goal is to hope to work with you all for this project . Looking for any feedbacks.  Really appreciated


[05/30/2022 23:06] hake_stake
Hi, is VE3DLocker.sol in scope?


[05/30/2022 23:12] 100proof
I'm interested in the finance terminology behind it. Does $150K at $500M MKV mean that the portion of the tokens distributed would be $150K if the entire supply was valued at $500M?


[05/30/2022 23:15] Jaqen#8180
not in the scope, but you may need to deploy it in order to fully test the flow.


[05/30/2022 23:16] hake_stake
thank you sir


[05/30/2022 23:16] Jaqen#8180
yeah, exactly, but feel free to dm if you have questions on this.

I see there's an Idle and an Angle network. But what about Pickle, Ribbon, Balancer etc?


[05/31/2022 00:45] 100proof
Also I've always wanted to know what is the `ve` prefix. Something like "voting escrow"?


[05/31/2022 01:00] Jaqen#8180
Yeah, we only include two projects for proof of concept and audit purpose . And audit scope will be within those two projects


[05/31/2022 01:00] Jaqen#8180
Yeah , exactly


[05/31/2022 11:46] un_for_given
Hi @Jaqen , "veToken Finance is an forked version of the convex yield protocol". Would you please provide Diff for veToken vs Convex? so we can focus on parts that were changed.  (Something like this: https://gist.github.com/stas/6611bbd3866e1873b09919f5bf0d3b37)


[05/31/2022 14:46] Jaqen#8180
Sure , let me try to create one now


[05/31/2022 15:19] 0xkitsune
Just for clarity, these are the only contracts in scope for security or for gas optimizations as well as security?


[05/31/2022 15:34] Jaqen#8180
It is for both , and you could find details here : 

$71,250 USDT main award pot
$3,750 USDT gas optimization award 


For VE3D rewards, would be similar rewards ratio

Hey, does ve3token suppose to be close to real represention of veAsset in 1:1 value?


[06/01/2022 20:16] vad37
I am confused with the logic curve of curve


[06/01/2022 20:34] Jaqen#8180
Thanks for reaching out ! Yeah Basically it is not guaranteed 1:1. It will be determined by supply and demand .

Just an FYI that the VE3D tokens have not yet launched; we'll distribute tokens once we receive them from the sponsor.

[08/10/2022 23:35] cloudellie
I don't know what the *value* of the tokens are, but we will use the standard C4 award distribution, so if you received a USDT payout, you'll also get tokens.

[08/10/2022 23:36] cloudellie
I realize this is a bit different from what the sponsor originally said but that's because they weren't aware of C4's policy at the time. 🙂

Thanks for all your guys help,  we are working with C4 to distribute VE3D as additional rewards once the token is launched.
